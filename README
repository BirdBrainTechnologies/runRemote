when_changed
============

Runs a Command when a file changes (Windows only)

usage:
when_changed (file path) (command) (optional-parameters)

when_changed C:\somedir\foo.txt myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\*.txt myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\**.txt myapp.exe   (recursive)
when_changed C:\somedir\* myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\** myapp.exe (recursive)
when_changed fileincurrentdir.txt myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\foo.txt myapp.exe bar wibble 123
when_changed C:\somedir\*.txt myapp.exe %file% 

Notes:
- Press 'F' to force the command to run.
- The utility will wait for the command to exit before running it again.
- The utility will will re-run the command if file changes whilst command is running.
- Beware of creating an infinite loop!
- (file path) must be a file path with wildcards -- not a directory.
- The search is recursive if the filename contains a double-asterisk ** (wildcards in directory names not supported.)
- Include a %file% parameter to pass the full path of the changed file to the target application. **Note this parameter omitted when 'force running' the target application**. (thanks to borconi)
